# Hedera Knowledge Graph Builder

The Hedera Knowledge Graph Builder project aims to create a tool for developers to create, explore and utilize knowledge graphs on Hedera.

This application is built and deployed to Hedera Testnet, and is submitted to the [Hedera Hello Future Hackathon](https://hellofuturehackathon.dev/).

## Introduction
The project has three major components:

- Backend API at [backend/](backend/): Utilize FastAPI to provide various API endpoints for database interaction, graph construction, graph query and other specific tasks.
- User Interface at [frontend/](frontend/): A ReactJS application for knowledge graph visualization and interaction.
- Subgraph at [subgraph/](subgraph/): Subgraph configuration for on-chain knowledge graph deployment and query. This is built upon the [Hedera Subgraph Example](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-subgraph-example)

## Installation
